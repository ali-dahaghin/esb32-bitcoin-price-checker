# esb32-bitcoin-price-checker

simple esb32 app for checking bitcoin price and change pin status using arduino framework.
if higher than  22000$ it make pin 13 HIGH and pin 13 is connected to pin 3 so pin 3 becomes HIGH as well.
it uses wifi to connect to internet and uses kucoin's public api to get current BTC-USDT.

it might be useful for having some action over bitcoin price going over a certion price.
